On this page you'll find some common issues and their solutions.

## Instant Run

We cannot guarantee ACRA will work with instant run enabled. Always try to reproduce an error with instant run disabled before reporting it. 

## Legacy Multidex

If you are using legacy multidex, ensure that `ACRA.init(...)` is called **after** `Multidex.install()`.

## Application.onCreate()

ACRA uses a service to send crash reports. This service runs in a **separate process** to ensure that reports can be sent even when your own VM is dying from an unhandled exception. This means that a new instance of your application will be started and `Application.onCreate()` will be called again. If you are performing once only tasks in `Application.onCreate()` then check the name of the current process and don't do them if the process name is `:acra`. You can use `ACRA.isACRASenderServiceProcess()` for this.
